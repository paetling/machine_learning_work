Results:
    * Cartpole
        * Got to some middling success based where my length of play is between 75 - 120. Did not seem to be able to consistantly
        do better than that

    * Breakout-ram
        * Was not able to improve performance much above random. I am not sure if it is the learning method or the algorithm
