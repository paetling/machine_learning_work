Results:
    * Cartpole with max Length of 5000:
        *Training with a batch size of 5 episodes, the learning algorithm had maxed out to lasting all 5000 steps after batch 150


    * Pendulum:
        * Training with a batch size of 5 episdoes, the training is not very stable and does not seem to find an optimal solution. I have seen it try and stop the movement at the bottom of the arc or try and maintain the initial speed of the pendulum forever.
